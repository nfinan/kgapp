(GPC was performed after subsequent steps to ensure that no drastic changes to the molecular weight of the polymer occurred.) For the composites, the NPs were then added via a micropipet and stirred for another hour at 60 °C. The samples were then probe sonicated for 3 min (looping 2 s on, 1 s off to minimize bond breaking) and cast in a Teflon dish at 60 °C in an oven at −5 in.Hg for 1 h to facilitate a mild evaporation process. The samples were then left in the vacuum oven for 1 day at room temperature and 1 day at 80 °C to remove any remaining solvent and to thermally anneal the polymer. A hot press was used at 80 °C to mold the samples into disks.</ExperimentalProcedure><SolutionProcessing><ChooseParameter><Additive><Description>5 wt % PEO was dissolved in THF and

sapphire disk for heat capacity and indium for temperature and
enthalpy.</Description><CycleInformation>Nonisothermal experiments were performed using a heat−cool−heat
protocol, with temperatures of 90, −20, and 90 °C and ramp rates of
20 °C/min, holding at each temperature for 5 min. To isothermally
crystallize the sample, the system was ramped down from 90 °C to a
designated Tc at 60 °C/min to prevent crystallization from occurring
at any undesired temperatures, then held isothermally to complete the
crystallization with a total time greater than at least 3 times tpeak, the
time of the peak heat flow during crystallization, and used as a proxy
for t50% during the experiment to estimate the time necessary to
complete crystallization.</CycleInformation></Differential_Scanning_Calorimetry><XRay_Diffraction_and_Scattering><Equipment>Ganesha, SAXSLAB</Equipment><Description>Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was
performed on a laboratory system at Columbia University (Ganesha,
SAXSLAB) with a Cu Kα source (λ = 1.54 Å), a Pilatus 300K
detector, and a variable sample-to-detector distance that covers a q
range of 0.004−1.2 Å−1. Additional SAXS was performed at
Brookhaven National Laboratory on the NSLS-II Complex Materials
Scattering beamline. Scattering was collected on a Pilatus 300K
detector with an energy of 13.5 keV and a sample-to-detector distance
of 5.036 m. Scattering experiments were done at room temperature
under vacuum unless otherwise stated. 2D scattering patterns were
integrated by using SAXSLAB’s saxsgui software to obtain I(q) data.
These were subsequently fit by using the SASfit software.</Description></XRay_Diffraction_and_Scattering><OpticalMicroscopy><Equipment>Polarized light optical microscopy (PLOM) was performed on a
Leica DFC320 with a λ-retardation plate between 45° crossed
polarizers to monitor the spherulitic growth of the polymer. Images
were recorded with a Wild Leitz digital camera. Temperature control
was performed with a Linkam LTS420 temperature hot stage.
Previously molded samples were further hot pressed between two
microscope slides to be ∼50 μm thick. The sample was heated to 90
°C and held for 5 min before cooling at 20 °C/min to a set Tc.
Multiple samples and runs at each temperature were performed to
provide a reproducible average growth rate, each measuring 2−3
spherulite diameters over 5−10 time stamps.</Equipment></OpticalMicroscopy></CHARACTERIZATION><PROPERTIES><Thermal><Crystallinity><DegreeOfCrystallization><value>68.4</value></DegreeOfCrystallization></Crystallinity><CrystalizationTemperature><value>56.5</value><unit>Celsius</unit></CrystalizationTemperature></Thermal></PROPERTIES></PolymerNanocomposite>
