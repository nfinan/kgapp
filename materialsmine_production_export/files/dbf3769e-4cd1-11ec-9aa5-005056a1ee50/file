"Highly pure grades of commercial particles of Al(OH)3 with a quoted average size of 30 nm was added by weight ratio. Hexadecyltrimethoxysilane was used as a coupling agent for
the surface modification of nano-Al(OH)3." "Surface modification was performed by a solution mixing
method. First, nano-Al(OH)3 was dispersed in acetone, and
then the coupling agent having a mass ratio of 1.5% to the
nanoparticles was added to the mixed solution. The ultrasonic
cell disruptor was used to prevent the agglomeration of
nanoparticles and provided a reaction temperature. After that,
the mixture was centrifuged for solid-liquid separation. Hexadecyltrimethoxysilane was used as a coupling agent for
the surface modification of nano-Al(OH)3." The acetone was removed and the nanoparticles separated were heated in the oven for 24 h and grinded. A torque rheometer was used to disperse the nanoparticles into the polyethylene pellets homogeneously at 120 o C, for this temperature is higher than the melting temperature and lower than the reaction temperature of dicumyl peroxide. Then thin film samples were prepared by hot pressing and this process was held at 140 o C for 20 min with a pressure of 10 MPa to ensure the fully crosslinking process. Before the measurements, samples were degassed at 70 o C for 24 h to exclude crosslinking by-products effectively.</ExperimentalProcedure><SolutionProcessing><ChooseParameter><Additive><Description>Dicumyl peroxide had been already added in the compound pellets.</Description><Additive>Dicumyl peroxide</Additive></Additive></ChooseParameter><ChooseParameter><Additive><Description>Highly pure grades of commercial particles of Al(OH)3 with a quoted average size of 30 nm was added by weight ratio.

The film samples (thickness: 0.17 mm, diameter: 60 mm) were put between the spherical electrodes (diameter: 25 mm), which were immersed in transformer oil to avoid surface flashover. First, the oil was heated to the test temperatures and then the samples were placed between the electrodes for 5 min before the test. The test temperatures were 20, 50, 70 and 90 o C. Each kind of samples has been tested 20 times. All the data presented here were acquired at a ramp rate of 3 kV/s. All experimental parameters were computer controlled and experimental data were logged automatically.</Description></Dielectric_and_Impedance_Spectroscopy_Analysis><Fourier_Transform_Infrared_Spectroscopy><Equipment>The FTIR spectra of XLPE and its nanocomposites were obtained utilizing an IR Prestige-21 spectrometer with the wave number varying from 4000 to 400 cm-1.

The thickness of the samples was about 250 μm. The top electrode was a semiconducting electrode and the bottom electrode was aluminum. An electric pulse with a duration of 10 ns and an amplitude of 400 V was applied to the sample to stimulate the space charge and to generate the acoustic signal. Silicone oil was used as acoustic coupling. The space charge curves were obtained under 40 kV/mm within 5 min.</Description></Pulsed_Electro_Acoustic></CHARACTERIZATION><PROPERTIES><Mechanical><Tensile><TensileModulus><value>79.1946377419824</value><unit>MPa</unit></TensileModulus></Tensile></Mechanical><Electrical><DielectricBreakdownStrength><Condition>DC</Condition><Profile><value>155.21344080187</value><unit>kV/mm</unit></Profile><WeibullParameter><description>scale parameter</description></WeibullParameter><WeibullParameter><description>shape parameter</description></WeibullParameter></DielectricBreakdownStrength></Electrical></PROPERTIES></PolymerNanocomposite>
